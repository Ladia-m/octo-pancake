Hi Salloweezy,

if you have any questions about my latest commit or just Linux/Git in general... ask me here
you can either edit the readme file in my directory on your terminal and push the changes
or edit it directly here on the website, (there is a pen icon somewhere and right from here) ---> then when your done
typing your question you will go to the bottoom of the page and 'commit directly into master' 
(we will study (branches and pull requests very soon)

try to update the script some more, clean up any stuff that doesnt look good and think about what we'll do next
See you!
