Hi man, I have writtena very simple script in my folder ( ../Endless/script.sh )

Go and read what I did and then you can check the results in the text file called ( ../result.txt )

Try and work out how the result of the commands go into the results file. 

There are LOTS of improvements that can be done to fix or update the code, 
so look through it and see what you can do. 

Look esp, for the TODO(SALLOWEEZY) parts <-- this is a convention to pass work on to other devs, through git, theres ways to track your TODO's. 
if you wanna leave some work for me, use TODO(ENDLESS). 

see if you can improve it, or add to it, or clean it up a bit ( I made it a mess on purpose :P ) 


Enjoy.
